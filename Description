A* Search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals.

A* Search algorithms, unlike other traversal techniques, it has “brains”. What it means is that it is really a smart algorithm which separates it from the other conventional algorithms.
many games and web-based maps use this algorithm to find the shortest path very efficiently (approximation).
